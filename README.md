## Project Overview

On **April 28, 2025**, Duolingo surprised users by announcing its decision to become an **AI-first** company. By combining Reddit data with state-of-the-art NLP techniques, this project reveals:
- How public emotions evolved around the AI announcement.
- The dominant sentiments expressed during critical phases.
- Whether Duolingo's clarification successfully shifted the narrative.

As a data science enthusiast and longtime Duolingo user (with a 1,775-day streak to prove it!), this project gave me a chance to apply NLP to real-world reactions during a corporate pivot. It highlights the crucial role of data science in extracting valuable insights from unstructured text data.


## Key Findings

- **Emotional Surges**: The "AI-first" announcement triggered sharp spikes in curiosity, confusion, and disappointment on Reddit, far surpassing earlier peaks during the "Duo is dead" campaign.
- **Sustained Concern**: While Duolingo's CEO clarified the stance, negative sentiments persisted, indicating continued community concerns.
- **Core Concerns**: Discussions centered around the impact of AI on human jobs and contractors, financial motivations, and direct effects on user engagement.

## Tech Stack  

- **Data Collection**: PRAW (Python Reddit API Wrapper)
- **Data Handling**: Pandas, NumPy, datetime
- **NLP & Text Processing**: Hugging Face Transformers (`joeddav/distilbert-base-uncased-go-emotions-student`), NLTK, SpaCy, emoji
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn, WordCloud, PIL


## How to Reproduce

1. **Clone the Repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/MathRC/sentiment-analysis-duolingo.git
    cd sentiment-analysis-duolingo
    ```


2. **Set Up the Environment**

    ```bash
    conda env create -f environment.yml
    conda activate sentiment-analysis-Duolingo
    ```

    Install SpaCy and NLTK data:
    ```bash
    python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
    python -c "import nltk; nltk.download('stopwords'); nltk.download('wordnet'); nltk.download('punkt')"
    ```


3. **Configure Reddit API Credentials**

    Create a `config.ini` with your Reddit API credentials in the project root:

    ```ini
    [reddit]
    client_id     = YOUR_CLIENT_ID
    client_secret = YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET
    username      = YOUR_REDDIT_USERNAME
    password      = YOUR_REDDIT_PASSWORD
    ```
    

4. **Run the Analysis**

    ```bash
    cd analysis
    jupyter notebook analysis.ipynb
    ```
    
    Follow the notebook to:

    * Collect data via PRAW
    * Preprocess text data
    * Perform sentiment analysis
    * Generate visualizations saved in `figures/`


## Visual Highlights

Here are some of the key visualizations from the project that illustrate the findings:

![Weekly Emotion Trends](figures/Fig2_weekly_emotion_trends.png)

> Figure 2: Weekly counts of the top 5 dominant emotions expressed on Reddit over time, with the "AI-first" announcement date marked.

<br>

![Contrasting Sentiments](figures/Fig3_contrasting_sentiments_trend.png)

> Figure 3: Comparison of Approval vs. Disapproval and Admiration vs. Disappointment shows negative sentiment persisted even after the May 23 CEO clarification.

![Word Cloud](figures/Fig4_wordcloud_spacy_small.png)

> Figure 4: Frequently discussed topics in the post-announcement period. Dominant themes like "human," "AI," and "job" reflect concerns about automation and workforce impact.
