## üîç Project Overview

On **April 28, 2025**, Duolingo surprised users by announcing its decision to become an **AI-first** company. By combining Reddit data with state-of-the-art NLP techniques, this project reveals:
- How public emotions evolved around the AI announcement.
- The dominant sentiments expressed during critical phases.
- Whether Duolingo's clarification successfully shifted the narrative.

As a data science enthusiast and longtime Duolingo user (with a 1,775-day streak to prove it!), this project gave me a chance to apply NLP to real-world reactions during a corporate pivot. It highlights the crucial role of data science in extracting valuable insights from unstructured text data.

## üìä Key Findings

- **Emotional Surges**: The "AI-first" announcement triggered sharp spikes in curiosity, confusion, and disappointment on Reddit, far surpassing earlier peaks during the "Duo is dead" campaign.
- **Sustained Concern**: While Duolingo's CEO clarified the stance, negative sentiments persisted, indicating continued community concerns.
- **Core Concerns**: Discussions centered around the impact of AI on human jobs and contractors, financial motivations, and direct effects on user engagement.
