I’m sad to say I’m not surprised, especially after Duolingo got rid of the Classes platform where people could get help and practice from real people with language learning. They had a staff to maintain the program, and it just wasn’t worth it to them. Then out comes Max with simulated video calls. Nowhere near a replacement for being immersed in a real conversation. I have Max currently, not planning to renew, and Lily AI often doesn’t understand if I say more than a sentence.

I stopped a few years ago when they made the “path” overhaul update because that’s how I felt about it - borderline unusable.

- Pronouns: Duo loves to make you type the subject pronoun and actually counts it as a mistake if you don't. This is problematic because in Italian you rarely do since verb conjugation is enough to understand who the subject is.

-Word order: Duo accepts only one word order and sometimes it's a straight up calque from English thus you end up being ""corrected"" when you type a totally acceptable sentence while simultaneously learning a very ""unusual"" Italian word order.

-Dubs: some dubs are either bugged or not properly recorded, you'd hear lines which get abruptly cut or lines that go on for some seconds extra for no reason whatsoever.

-Synonyms: Duo is very strict when it comes to what word you are supposed to use, it doesn't conceive the possibility of a user adopting a synonym.

1. AI & Duolingo Max  
2. Heart System

comment,mgjjkxw,1741368457.0,,"So... This is probably going to feel like a personal attack for many people... But like ANY learning process, the largest thing isn't the method or style of education. Let me explain. 

Let's say, hypothetically you have two people, we will call them person A and person B. And they are both learning on Duolingo. Got this example, to keep it simple, we will say both people are learning Spanish.

Person A puts all their effort into working through the units as quickly as they can. They spend 30 mins a day just doing lessons. And that's all they do. It's highly likely their Spanish score would climb rapidly. 

Person B spend 10 minutes a day working on units, learning new things. But they also spend 10 minutes a day using the workout sessions to practice what they have learned. Their Spanish score would be lower, and theoretically they will learn less. But they are reinforcing their learning with practice. But they are only learning for 20 minutes a day here. So what if they took the left over 10 minutes a day and used that to research outside of Duolingo. Maybe they listen to music, watch YouTube videos teaching Spanish. Maybe they watch some shows in Spanish with subtitles. 

Out of these two examples, who you think is more likely to retain their Spanish skills over the course of a year of learning. It's going to be person B. 

Here's another example, I'm in college studying a subject I've never studied before. That being counselling and psychotherapy. I'm in all the same classes as everyone else on the course, I have access to all the same information as others on my course. But yet, very often they are confused and struggling with assignments. Me, on the other hand, I like to learn. So I've been using my access to the EBSCO research library. They have access too through college. 

They struggle to write assignments and get good grades, yet I'm writing assignments that would get good grades at a far higher level of education. But why is that? 

It's simply a case of diversification of learning. No teacher, be that a human, or an app. Is perfect. There are missing things, gaps in knowledge, explanations that aren't worded how the learner needs. Etc.

So, there are three major aspects to learning anything in my mind. The first, is the most obvious. Time! How much time do you spend learning has a massive impact on how much you learn. But learning lots isn't helpful if you forget. So the second major aspect is reinforcement. You have to reinforce your learning with external sources. For my college course, that is reading books and studies on the subject. For Duolingo, that is listening to other educational sources. And once you have a good enough grasp also watching native content. The final aspect of learning is repetition. You need to use whatever information you have learned to truly internalise it. For me, I made friends who speak Spanish. Which is fairly difficult to do here in the UK. But that means I'm chatting in a Spanish/English mix on a regular basis.",3,,https://www.reddit.com/r/duolingo/comments/1j5r688/is_duolingo_actually_effective/,duolingo,GOTSpectrum,,,pre_decision,t3_1j5r688,2025-03-07 17:27:37,so... this is probably going to feel like a personal attack for many people... but like any learning process the largest thing isnt the method or style of education. let me explain. lets say hypothetically you have two people we will call them person a and person b. and they are both learning on duolingo. got this example to keep it simple we will say both people are learning spanish. person a puts all their effort into working through the units as quickly as they can. they spend 30 mins a day just doing lessons. and thats all they do. its highly likely their spanish score would climb rapidly. person b spend 10 minutes a day working on units learning new things. but they also spend 10 minutes a day using the workout sessions to practice what they have learned. their spanish score would be lower and theoretically they will learn less. but they are reinforcing their learning with practice. but they are only learning for 20 minutes a day here. so what if they took the left over 10 minutes a day and used that to research outside of duolingo. maybe they listen to music watch youtube videos teaching spanish. maybe they watch some shows in spanish with subtitles. out of these two examples who you think is more likely to retain their spanish skills over the course of a year of learning. its going to be person b. heres another example im in college studying a subject ive never studied before. that being counselling and psychotherapy. im in all the same classes as everyone else on the course i have access to all the same information as others on my course. but yet very often they are confused and struggling with assignments. me on the other hand i like to learn. so ive been using my access to the ebsco research library. they have access too through college. they struggle to write assignments and get good grades yet im writing assignments that would get good grades at a far higher level of education. but why is that? its simply a case of diversification of learning. no teacher be that a human or an app. is perfect. there are missing things gaps in knowledge explanations that arent worded how the learner needs. etc. so there are three major aspects to learning anything in my mind. the first is the most obvious. time! how much time do you spend learning has a massive impact on how much you learn. but learning lots isnt helpful if you forget. so the second major aspect is reinforcement. you have to reinforce your learning with external sources. for my college course that is reading books and studies on the subject. for duolingo that is listening to other educational sources. and once you have a good enough grasp also watching native content. the final aspect of learning is repetition. you need to use whatever information you have learned to truly internalise it. for me i made friends who speak spanish. which is fairly difficult to do here in the uk. but that means im chatting in a spanishenglish mix on a regular basis.,confusion,0.20666977763175964

App Crashes and Freezes:
Users have reported Duolingo crashing or freezing, especially during lessons, which can be frustrating. 
Lesson Loading Problems:
Some users have encountered difficulties opening lessons or seeing an error message like “Something went wrong, please check the internet and try again later”. 
Potential Causes:
Insufficient Device Memory: Running out of storage space on your iPhone can cause Duolingo to crash or freeze. 
Outdated Duolingo Version: Using an older version of the app might lead to compatibility issues or bugs.

Last night I got an answer wrong because I chose “wheat” as what a hail storm ruined and the correct answer was “strawberries”. At least in Spanish, Unit 6, this happens regularly. Last week an entire unit mistranslated its answers by swapping the order and interpretation of gerunds and infinitives.

The fact that *paying subscribers* can't even get support is ridiculous. The price they charge to basically just not have ads is exorbitant. 

Funny that when I reached out for support, they had the manpower to both reply to tell me they weren't going to help and to remove my profile picture (of my dog).

comment,mlohqf8,1743935711.0,,"I also feel the end is close to me. Since the hearts came back a couple weeks ago, I barely do anything. After almost 2 years using unlimited hearts thanks to Schools, I came to realize some aspects of language learning that make Duolingo to no longer be suitable for language learning, even for beginners.

When you are learning a language, you do mistakes. It is expected. I'd rather have mistakes and Duolingo corrects me, instead of having to waste time cheating with google translator so I don't lose a heart.

But the most serious and what is making me to quit, it's the fact that when you learn a language, you will face challenges, and the only way to get better at a language is to face challenges. It's pointless to do Duolingo and all the exercises are easy, you would be stuck, right? You need more challenging content so you improve. But Duolingo punishes mistakes, that way, when you face challenges, you are just gonna lose the hearts. It's a natural process. I realized about this when I was for half a month with Greek. If I'm going to face such hard language and have mistakes, and Duolingo is gonna punish me for that, then it's useless, because most likely I cannot even finish 1 lesson per day.

I'm at 742 days and I plan to quit at 1000 but lately I'm just doing 1 exercise just to keep moving. I find less and less reasons to use it. I still wanna finish the hanzi section of Chinese and around 35 units of English for Chinese speakers, just because I get more Chinese vocabulary. But after that, I'm totally done. I was thinking in doing Portuguese course but even if it would be very easy for me (I'm Spanish), I think I won't bother.

I believe most people separate being fluent from being conversant. Being fluent involves being conversant, but being conversant doesn’t mean being fluent if that makes sense.

It’s not perfect in any way, it was hard at the beginning, especially because she started conversations with things duo did not teach me yet like げんきですか？ But I adapted quickly and I find it to be a really useful addition as it teaches me to conjure the language from memory on the spot and allows me to practice forming sentences, making them more complex and so on…

submission,1jwgk9d,1744342302.0,Duolingo Max is seriously hurting user experience of Super users,"I'm on a 214-day streak, and I spend at least 20mins a day on Duolingo. The first day I used the app, I subbed to Duolingo Super. My partner, family, and friends all enjoyed the app very much.

However, recently the strategy to push for upgrading to Duolingo Max has become outrageous; two items in the menu are basically ads for Max. I understand that Duolingo is a public company now and is driven by revenue growth and profit growth for a better return for stakeholders, but let's be honest: the GenAI feature in Max is horrible. You guys screwed up, and you can't expect users to pay almost **twice** the price annually for useless/incomplete GenAI features just by putting them at the most obvious place and constantly popping ads. Maybe you are doing this because Duolingo still has 'moats', given that there are almost no competitors as good as Duolingo, but sacrificing user experience is unsustainable.

Please focus on improving Duolingo Max or finding an alternative way to boost your revenue. There's a reason people won't upgrade to Max: it's just not good.

comment,mikojz3,1742363964.0,,"hiii, native Spanish speaker here! When you say aburrísima you're saying it's really boring, but you are referring to just one thing, singular. But when you say aburridisimas, you are using the plural instead of singular. 
How can you recognize that? Well, in Spanish, substantives have categories (proper, common, simple, etc). There is another category called countab and noncountable. So, in the sentence, the subject would be musica. So let's analyze it.

Musica would be common since it's not a proper name, would be simple since it's not made of two combined words (ex: cortauñas, arcoiris) and would be non countable. Why is that? Non countable substantives are the ones you can't count using numbers. For example, you can say la musica, but you can't say una musica, dos músicas. The same thing happens with water (un agua, dos aguas) or happiness (un felicidad, dos felicidades) it's just wrong. So these types of substantives should always be addressed in singular.

I'd like to push back on this a little bit. If you want to be fluent in a language, yes you absolutely do have to be able to say ""The pigs are cooking dinner in the kitchen tonight."" You're probably never going to use that sentence, but if you don't understand that sentence then you don't understand English. It doesn't really matter what the content of the sentence is, it matters whether you understand the meanings of the words and the grammar rules which link the words together. If you know that it doesn't make sense that the pigs are the ones cooking dinner, that's good, that proves you understand the words and the rules. If you only understand the rules but you don't know what a pig is, then the sentence makes perfect sense, and if you only know the definitions but not the the rules then the sentence makes perfect sense. It is only by understanding the two together that you can realize ""oh, pigs aren't the ones who usually cook dinner, that sentence is unusual"" If you're speaking a language in the wild, you're going to encounter tons of sentences that don't make literal sense. Idioms, song lyrics / poetry, jokes, etc. If you only ever prepare for sentences that you can easily map to some kind of conversational flowchart, you're not going to be very flexible.

Quizlet has fun learning modes, but I’m not a fan of the interface or how adding/editing cards works — plus, no built-in translator.

\[*self-promo alert* 😅\] That’s why I built **Conflit**. It lets you translate and create cards from translations, use AI to generate new cards, and review with quizzes, typing, or swiping flashcards. The coolest part? When you learn a word like *“gracias – thank you”*, it gives you a real-life context, like *“gracias por su ayuda – thank you for your help”*, and every time you review the word, it generates a new example so you don’t just memorize one sentence. Might be worth a shot! 😊

At 108 hours for receptive skills. It seems like you are right on target. How well did you do with Productive Skills-Speaking and Writing?

Here are some made up numbers about how long each of the CEFR levels take: 
A1 - 90-100 hours, A2 - 180-200 hours, B1 - 350-400 hours, B2 - 500-600 hours, C1 - 700-800 hours, and C2 - 1,000-1,200 hours.

I think those numbers are off. My experience has been nearly double on all of them.

So by my own personal estimation you did really well on the receptive skills getting to that point that quickly.

It will be interesting to see what it takes you get over the A2 hump.

submission,1jnwwxt,1743402543.0,Prompt + Flash Card App for Language Learning,"I've been learning languages using Duolingo for quite some time but I have barely made any progress. I heard that some people had better luck training by speaking to AI. Since I have a chatgpt subscription anyways, I would like to use it to learn. Does anyone have experience in that regard?

1. Which LLM should I use?
I'm not bound to chatgpt, if there's any which you works better for you I might switch. My only priority is that I can have a discussion (Talk over my microphone and AI responds in written text) Right now what bothers me with chatgpt mobile is, that while talking to it it doesn't display the text, so if you know a better alternative let me know!

2. Any good suggestions for a prompt?
I want to give the LLM a prompt, and then daily for 30 minutes talk in that chat box. Ideally, after every session I would like to be able to export all new vocabulary which I could then import into a flashcards app.

3. Which flash cards app should I use? Right now I'm using phase6, which I really like due to the flash cards being read to me. However, it doesn't allow you to import new flashcards. Do you know of an app which allows to import flashcards on mobile, and ideally is also able to read them aloud? I know the last point is probably too much to ask, but just having a prompt which outputs a file which I can then import in my flashcards on mobile only would already be a huge game changer for me.

submission,1iy7a3e,1740521137.0,What are the most important conversations you want to be able to have in your new language?,"I've been trying to learn a new language for about 2 years. Before Duolingo had AI-based conversations, I decided I needed to move beyond grammar/vocab and really focus on real-life conversations. I built an app to do this (I won't provide a link here so that this isn't viewed as a ""sales"" post) and implemented several conversations I wanted to get great at. Now that I've mastered those, I'm wondering what additional conversations people think it would be great to simulate and practice. If you have ideas of additional conversations that you think are critical to master, I'd love to hear them and will implement the ones that get the most feedback. My app is free so, if I implement something new, you'll be able to practice it too. Here's what I've included so far:

* Introducing yourself and finding out about someone else's job/family/etc.
* Making plans to do something 
* Making a restaurant reservation
* Being seated at a restaurant
* Ordering breakfast at a restaurant
* Ordering a snack from a market stall
* Buying an item (shirt) from a store
* Negotiating a price for an item at a store
* Booking a flight
* Checking in at the airport

I’m currently building a vocabulary-learning website where you can study words from a dictionary and test yourself in multiple ways (flashcards, quizzes, etc.). Right now, I’m starting with French, but the goal is to support multiple languages in the future and also make it grammar, speaking, listening and reading compatible.

I want to make this app as useful as possible, so I’d love to hear your suggestions!

* What features would make this the best vocabulary-learning tool for you?
* Do you prefer flashcards, fill-in-the-blank, or multiple-choice quizzes?
* Would a progress tracker or AI-generated example sentences be helpful?
* Any pain points with existing apps like Duolingo, Anki, Quizlet that you wish were improved?

Yes.

Seriously, just write your own resume.  It's really obvious, and should be really embaressing, when I get an AI generated resume.  

And they're *never* accurate.  Like, not even in that 'fake it till you make it' way that resumes usually embellish, but in a wholesale 'this is just not true' kinda way.  Not a single person we've interviewed with an obviously AI generate resume has ever passed the first round of interviews.

comment,merjlys,1740515792.0,,">AI *investment* is growing far more than 10%, but the entire point of the CEO's commentary is that the value created by AI *isn't living up to the investment*

AI investment isn't growing at 10+ trillion dollars a year, that bit didn't make much sense to me.

*'The elephants remember.'*

I'm like... what do they remember? It's just idiotic AI building context-less sentences. You cannot learn a language mindlessly repeating/memorising context-less phrases.

Or: match madness:

It wanted me to pair *'I look'* with *'paio'* in Italian. Rlly? #facepalm. It's just AI hallucinating.

Or: Spanish Duolingo - the most surreal sentence to be translated I have ever heard in my life: *'She wanted them to talk to us about the neighborhood where they rent.'*

Humans learn from seeing others art. It influences them, even a miniscule amount, then they go onto create more art.

But when computers do it, it's wrong? At this point the argument typically goes into the differences between humans and computers.

I think many people don't realize these ai do learn on a higher level/more abstract basis (e.g. they can learn style, light/shadow, perspective, composition, emotion).

Maybe I will leave after I get energy, maybe I will then come back if they tweak it again. If the course I am doing will become bad, I will leave. So far, the course I am doing had no changes in it.

comment,mpxb5l2,1746053825.0,,"Well the stock price closed at $389.48 today. That is up from $370.00 last Wednesday.

First quarter earning for 2025 will be reported tomorrow at https://investors.duolingo.com/events#upcoming-events. These of course will not reflect the recent drama of the AI announcement.

**So we may not know how big of an impact the boycott will have for quite awhile yet.** And we don't know how many contractors will be lost. They cut back on contractors several years back, I have no idea how many remain. 

**If the boycott makes an impact that still places them in a quandary.** Do they abandon AI when they are competing with AI? Or do they stick with it as they announced and try to do a better job with it than their competition? 

I watched this video [Duolingo Stock Analysis: I Highlight 3 Risks Investors Should Know and Update My Recommendations](https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/04/30/duolingo-stock-analysis-i-highlight-3-risks-invest/) early today. He brought up the interesting point that Duo is not only competing with other language learning apps, but also with other AI services in general. 

I've seen a lot of quitting posts here, but I wonder what the actual percentage will turn out to be. It may very well be insignificant given that many of us are staying with Duo. With over 100 million active monthly users, it would take a lot of people quitting to make a dent in things.

comment,mre9aly,1746785966.0,,"So, my turn. I reached day 300 yesterday, and this is where I'll stop.

I wanted to learn Korean. I started to use Duo, but after I while I noticed that there was barely any grammar explained and that I had to understand the sentences' structures all by myself. Which was hard AND time-consuming. Nonetheless, I managed to push myself up to the highest league in last August. Then I started to become a bit annoyed at the real lack of grammar, and I tried to speak with a Korean girl who, basically, understood half I said even if they were simple sentences (she seemed very confused). I also realized that Google Translation offered more often than not a different sentence that Duo, which did not help.

And, honestly, the whole ""I'll push you all the time to do your lesson"" grew old on me. I was not pushed to learn more, I was pressured into checking today's box and that was not really funny (plus the angry faces and so on). Or, when you start a lesson, go over midnight and bam! you got iced. Still, I was roughly at 2/3 of the course so I thought, hey, let's get this done before moving on.

Then there was the strike. A week ago, I saw a note saying that Duolingo made huge changes to the Korean course and that my progress has been reformated. Okay, then. On the moment I was just curious. I saw that I've been forwarded twenty lessons further, and in result I did not get what was happening anymore.

Before the update, I was between 5 to 15 minutes a lesson. There, I needed like an hour (which I don't have). Since I'm on the free version, that meant four tries, twenty ads, and a lot of frustration. Holy frak ! And still no grammar in view, when the sentences went from ""I went to Spain last week"" to ""Minjun, were you ready to go to see your grandmother, by any chance ?"".

So I lost a lot of gems. Noticed that the streak freezes also got more expensive. Still tried. I went to 299....

Last night, it took me even more time to complete the lesson. More than an hour, more than thirty minutes for the last try. I went mad with frustration. Even the words offered in the help didn't match the list of words you have to use in order to complete the sentence. The fuck is going on ? How I am supposed to know which word means what, with more than twenty lessons zapped ?

So I've payed the gems needed to complete the lesson, got the 300 mark... and installed Lingodeer.

As for me, first I decided I'm going to stick it out with Duo at least until December.

Second, I have yet to find a nice free app with a good UI for studying and practicing Japanese. I KNOW that Duo's Japanese lessons aren't great. It's not my ONLY source of Japanese practice.  
Until I can find an alternative convenient app that I can learn Japanese on, I'll probably be sticking it out with Duo.

A couple weeks ago it tried to get me to say the year in Swahili, which as it turns out is basically said the same way as in Spanish (ex: 1908 would be one thousand nine hundred and eight), but the hover over hint for that would be how it's said in English. I probably should've given up then but I guess I wasn't done hyperfocusing yet.

comment,ms8vkym,1747218381.0,,"This is where I've been at with Duolingo tbh

Also learning Korean, over 1100 days on Duo but steadily having more and more problems with it. I've already been seeking better resources elsewhere, but the streak was hard to let go of, and I figured it was better to have *something* every day for the days I didn't have as much time to put more time into learning. Plus I've been using my mum and stepdad's premium account so at least it's less painful to get through lessons without the ads and heart restrictions.

First strike was them removing the 'Tips' section that had actual, detailed grammar explanations. They've been preserved by users on other websites but the fact they're no longer in the actual game was a huge loss, now replaced with barebones grammar tips that do not cover anywhere near all the elements that appear in the sentences. And then they also removed all the user generated content and the discussion forums where people could get more help from real people. And the 'Tips' sections are now just unexplained example sentences. I need focused, well-explained grammar lessons to understand something properly. I need to know how the sentence works, I need to be able to deconstruct it, and that's hard without grammar explanations. I can't learn fully if I'm just having sentences thrown at me expecting me to figure it out through constant repetition

You're absolutely the right about the sentence complexity jumping massively way too quickly, particles I've never seen before being thrown in without any explanation of how they work before I've fully mastered the previous grammar form. And now the reformatted course (that I guess I missed the announcement on) means I'm being given very complex sentences I've never even seen before when I'm trying to do review sessions. I don't even know where I am in the course anymore and it's incredibly frustrating that even an app I'm using a little a day is throwing me through an entire loop like this.

comment,msfwwjm,1747313912.0,,"a duolingo subscription is what, 12 bucks a month? 1000x that is 12,000. are duolingo employees really making 12k a month -- 144k a year? i doubt the contractors writing the exercises were making that, even if some of the programmers might be. they aren't firing the programmers though, they're firing the writers.

so i think the equivalent would be more like 300 or 400 subscribers costs duolingo the same as 1 contractor. and a lot more people are quitting duolingo than just a few hundred or a few thousand over this. duolingo doesn't make their number of subscribers public though so there's no way to know.

another thing is you seem to be implying that profit for a company directly translates into shareholder stock value, but that isn't how it works. how profitable a company is can influence the value of a stock, but it's not the main factor. there are companies that are not profitable at all, but their stock goes up each year because of anticipation of future profits. amazon, for 10+ years, made zero profit, but its stock price kept going up, despite them not being a profitable company. so profit and stock value are often not very directly linked anyway. if a company has a profitable quarter, it can cause a bump in stock price, sometimes, but it's all about perception. stock is valued at what people perceive the value of that stock is, it's not based on how well that company actually is doing, it's smoke and mirrors. that's why i feel this entire post misses the point of how stocks work, duolingo's stock going up doesn't mean duolingo is doing well as a company.",2,,https://i.redd.it/4z89x8jqvw0f1.png,duolingo,rinkuhero,,,post_decision,t1_msfh3t0,2025-05-15 12:58:32,a duolingo subscription is what 12 bucks a month? 1000x that is 12000. are duolingo employees really making 12k a month 144k a year? i doubt the contractors writing the exercises were making that even if some of the programmers might be. they arent firing the programmers though theyre firing the writers. so i think the equivalent would be more like 300 or 400 subscribers costs duolingo the same as 1 contractor. and a lot more people are quitting duolingo than just a few hundred or a few thousand over this. duolingo doesnt make their number of subscribers public though so theres no way to know. another thing is you seem to be implying that profit for a company directly translates into shareholder stock value but that isnt how it works. how profitable a company is can influence the value of a stock but its not the main factor. there are companies that are not profitable at all but their stock goes up each year because of anticipation of future profits. amazon for 10 years made zero profit but its stock price kept going up despite them not being a profitable company. so profit and stock value are often not very directly linked anyway. if a company has a profitable quarter it can cause a bump in stock price sometimes but its all about perception. stock is valued at what people perceive the value of that stock is its not based on how well that company actually is doing its smoke and mirrors. thats why i feel this entire post misses the point of how stocks work duolingos stock going up doesnt mean duolingo is doing well as a company.,confusion,0.2522358000278473

submission,1kccqnr,1746116264.0,Sad Truth: All the Language Apps Are AI Now,"The sad truth is any language learning app uses AI to replace contractors nowadays - either for course content generation and validation, or by exposing AI (LLM)-based features. The reason for that is simple: the goal of any language learning app is not to employ as many course editor contractors as possible. Their goal is to make money by selling you access to course content consumable on a mobile device.

LLMs are extremely good at language tasks - they clearly outperform classic translation methods (infamous Google Translate). They are good at building language courses, both on a strategic level and at the lesson level. It's easy to validate this by asking ChatGPT to generate a Duo-like lesson for a specific topic in your language of choice.

**Memrise?** [Openly AI-based content](https://www.reddit.com/r/memrise/comments/1ak5bik/bye_memrise_you_deserve_it/).  
**Busuu?** [Confirmed to use AI to generate lessons](https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/1dsungy/use_of_ai_in_busuu_and_other_language_learning/) (yes, they're replacing contractors with AI).  
**Duo contractors?** Definitely using AI and reselling results to Duo - unless they’re extremely dumb.

Anyone who tries to do business the old way, hiring more contractors to build more courses, will lose. There is no way to stay out of AI-generated courses and stay afloat. Duo has not “changed the way to replace REAL people with EVIL AI.” Like all competitors, they've been providing you with AI-generated content for a while.

The Duo CEO just openly stated the current state of things: users cannot tell the difference and often prefer AI-based content when given a choice - especially if the choice is between “AI content” or “no content.”

Want to learn a language? Choose the tool that works for you - they're all AI-based nowadays.  
Switching from Duo to a competitor? Be aware that competitors are also using AI to replace contractors. Choose what’s best for you, not for “contractors.”

I think this is true but was likely inevitable, unfortunately. They had their product free for a very long time and gave everyone access to pretty much everything they had to offer. 

When going public, they could have become a fully paid app. But they didn't want to do that. Having tiers is the next best option. And there weren't many options aside from shifting certain features, etc., to the paid ones. 

It was never going to remain ""everything completely free forever"". That's not sustainable or feasible. 

I think one of their biggest weaknesses has always been that they are, quite frankly, terrible at communication. They make changes without explanation or advanced notice, and so people feel like the rug has been pulled out from underneath them.

comment,msgdu7d,1747319442.0,,"Thank you for the kind words! There are so many things for us to focus on at any one time, so I’m glad to hear you find the end result polished. As a developer it can be hard to see beyond all the things you want to improve 😅

I do want to clarify that we are actually a team of five full-time staff: One managing the language, one programmer, one game designer, and two artists. We also work on contract with at least one language teacher that is a native speaker of each language to build the curriculum, as well as another one to review that content.

The comment by u/kindrex0413 is accurate in regards to AI, we don’t use it in the app and have no plans to. Here's our current thinking on this: 

* When you are learning a language you need to be able to trust the source you are learning it from, not just in terms of accuracy but also all the little nuances within each language. We feel that working with multiple native speakers who teach the language professionally is the best way to be confident in our language content. Even if an AI gives the correct answer, it might be missing that nuance, or it might translate it in a way that doesn’t match the goals of that topic in the curriculum. And worst of all, how could we know if we don’t speak the language?
* In addition to accuracy errors, a large number of people just don’t want it in their apps. The implementation is often annoying and feels shoehorned into the experience, and there are ethical dilemmas that rightfully rub people the wrong way. I think it’s important for companies to respect their users, and I think the language learning community has been pretty clear that at this point in time they actively don’t want to use AI features.

* We like working with people! One of the most exciting parts of starting this company was to be able to build a super talented team that has honed their craft, and to work with them every day on a product we are all proud of. We get a lot of value from everyone’s unique perspective, and it doesn’t feel like deeply embedding AI into everyone’s job, or replacing people altogether, would improve our lives or the product.",5,,https://www.reddit.com/r/duolingo/comments/1kktuwr/we_created_lingo_legend_to_help_you_learn_a/,duolingo,arcbox,,,post_decision,t1_mrzf4ig,2025-05-15 14:30:42,thank you for the kind words! there are so many things for us to focus on at any one time so im glad to hear you find the end result polished. as a developer it can be hard to see beyond all the things you want to improve grinning_face_with_sweat i do want to clarify that we are actually a team of five fulltime staff one managing the language one programmer one game designer and two artists. we also work on contract with at least one language teacher that is a native speaker of each language to build the curriculum as well as another one to review that content. the comment by is accurate in regards to ai we dont use it in the app and have no plans to. heres our current thinking on this when you are learning a language you need to be able to trust the source you are learning it from not just in terms of accuracy but also all the little nuances within each language. we feel that working with multiple native speakers who teach the language professionally is the best way to be confident in our language content. even if an ai gives the correct answer it might be missing that nuance or it might translate it in a way that doesnt match the goals of that topic in the curriculum. and worst of all how could we know if we dont speak the language? in addition to accuracy errors a large number of people just dont want it in their apps. the implementation is often annoying and feels shoehorned into the experience and there are ethical dilemmas that rightfully rub people the wrong way. i think its important for companies to respect their users and i think the language learning community has been pretty clear that at this point in time they actively dont want to use ai features. we like working with people! one of the most exciting parts of starting this company was to be able to build a super talented team that has honed their craft and to work with them every day on a product we are all proud of. we get a lot of value from everyones unique perspective and it doesnt feel like deeply embedding ai into everyones job or replacing people altogether would improve our lives or the product.,gratitude,0.23595276474952698

comment,msghl4d,1747320562.0,,"Support from our early players was super important in getting to where we are now, so thank you! I bet a lot has changed in the game since you last played, so I’d say it’s worth giving another look.

Similar to us, Duolingo’s primary goal is to keep you engaged while learning. While their approach works for many people, we find their engagement features to be pretty surface level compared to what we can do by embedding learning into a game. At any one time in Lingo Legend you might be making progress on one of several progression systems, such as completing a farm quest, trying to hatch an animal with a specific set of properties, contributing to your guild’s shipment of resources, defeating a boss, and so on. These gameplay systems are great at keeping the momentum going, and they especially shine when you inevitably reach a challenging part of the curriculum as they keep you from getting discouraged while you slow down and work through it.

We are also working on features that integrate the learning into the gameplay itself, such as translating the in-game dialogue and implementing helpful learning tools so you can learn in more immersive ways. We think players will be more engaged by learning within the context of the overarching story and the characters they’ve interacted with compared to isolated exercises found in Duolingo.

While I am not super familiar with Duolingo's Chinese course I would say one of our key advantages is that we don't rely on awkward example sentences or grammar drills that native speakers would never actually say. As I've mentioned a few times, our focus for all our content has been practicality combined with a belief that one of the best ways to internalize grammar and vocabulary is through repeated exposure. We believe this is done better with meaningful sentences instead of random ones.

In terms of how advanced our courses are today, we offer broad coverage for beginner to lower-intermediate level learners, though we have many ideas on how we can better support more advanced learners. We also include mini lessons at the beginning of grammar-focused topics that explain the key concepts that you are about to cover.

submission,1kudiaf,1748098545.0,Should Duolingo align character grammar with their genders??,"From time to time I notice sentences like these..

From the Duolingo lore we know that Oscar is a middle-aged male school teacher, probably specializing in history or art.

You can use apps like Habits to track daily tasks and streaks, and set up reminders.

comment,mq7bb26,1746196351.0,,"I mean it's been demonstrated time and time again that when it comes to reliable information, AI is not  able to compete with experts that know what they're talking about.  I mean I looked up a place with google yesterday and Gemini told me it was in a city an hour away from where it is.  

The fact that you trust AI more than humans when it comes to information when they have shown poor reliability shows a bias that is not good.  It's not your ability to have an opinion I have an issue with.  It's the fact that by looking at your profile I can see you have a bias based on your experience and emotions and not based on the facts. 

 I'm sure one day AI will be more reliable.  Similar to how Magnus Carlson admits he can't beat a chess bot on its highest difficulty.  The reality is for applications like this it's not there yet.  Duolingo even admits it will affect quality.  

They aren't a startup anymore.  They have a responsibility to the people who rely on them to give a quality product to the end user.  Realistically, this is going to hurt their end user and their employees.  

Not only that but there's a difference between companies switching to AI for it to benefit all and a difference between switching because it's cheaper and you're willing to sacrifice quality for profits.  ""AI first"" for Duolingo currently means ""profits first"" and that's behavior to dislike in a company.  Especially one meant on education.  It should be ""education first"".  

If  they want to develop AI as it grows let them do more testing and only get rid of humans once the AI is up to speed and able to give quality.  I do actually agree that, while AI will unfortunately take jobs, it is part of a new industrial revolution and will create other jobs with the ones it takes.  The problem to me especially is how Duolingo is doing it.  The companies going to this level are going for profits not quality.  And they're screwing the working class to do it.

submission,1kclpxi,1746139014.0,I tried one of the new “built with AI” courses and quality seems poor,"Given all the backlash to Duo’s “AI-first” announcement, I wanted to actually try out one of the 140+ new courses they’ve been touting as only being possible thanks to AI. Picked Portuguese to Korean because I found English to Korean quite difficult, wanted to see how this course compared, and was even cautiously optimistic it might be better. 

Lesson 1 is immediately way too advanced (ordering at a café), with no intro lessons devoted to learning the writing system. In fact, the tab at the bottom for learning Korean characters that’s available in the English to Korean course is nowhere to be found in this course.

Got through Lesson 1 but gave up half way through Lesson 2 when I realized that tapping words to see their meaning seemed broken. Here’s an example where tapping a word tells me it means “raspadinha” in Portuguese, which isn’t an option in the word bank below. Learned by getting the question wrong that I was supposed to use “bingsu”. (Plus, “bingsu” means nothing to me as a beginner who’s not super familiar with Korean cuisine.)

I’ve been on Duo since 2013. I’ve studied 34 courses to various levels. I was willing to see what Duo could do with AI, but was disappointed that this course seems poorly implemented. It’s discouraging if not completely unusable for beginning language learners.

submission,1kzdd4c,1748633910.0,Did they replace old stories with AI-generated ones? (French from English),"**tl;dr** - as the title says, it seems like Duolingo’s just issued a ton of brand-new stories, and they all look AI-generated.

Longread:

I’ve just opened the app, and in the French from English course all (in the literal sense of the word) the old, familiar stories are gone. Granted, there are new stories (it seems like there are more stories now than before), but:

* they are read in strangely accentuated, almost monotone voices
* they are at, like, 1.5 speed (??)
* they are absolutely unimaginative

The dialogues are predictable or at the very least they lack plot twists and indeed any significant plot at all. All the character lines and the scripts as a whole look absolutely robotic.

These are *non-stories*. A couple examples:

Lin questions Lucy about lots of strange deaths in their family (what the actual f?) — and then this gem of a dialogue takes place:

*“I know nothing.”*

*“Seriously?”*

*“Yes, seriously.”*

Same for Oscar and Lucy on the stage at some painters event, where nobody is listening to Oscar because Lucy is telling jokes on the same stage:

*“But you are not even a painter!”*

*“So what? People like my jokes.”*

Or something to this extent. I confess I couldn’t force myself to finish even a single one yet.

The horror. 

Meanwhile, in my long-finished Dutch from English course there are no stories at all. In the French from Dutch course there are still the good old stories, with a plot, meaningful dialogues and human-sounding voices.",23,21.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/duolingo/comments/1kzdd4c/did_they_replace_old_stories_with_aigenerated/,duolingo,ajaxas,General Discussion,0.82,post_decision,,2025-05-30 19:38:30,did they replace old stories with aigenerated ones? french from english tldr as the title says it seems like duolingos just issued a ton of brandnew stories and they all look aigenerated. longread ive just opened the app and in the french from english course all in the literal sense of the word the old familiar stories are gone. granted there are new stories it seems like there are more stories now than before but they are read in strangely accentuated almost monotone voices they are at like 1.5 speed ?? they are absolutely unimaginative the dialogues are predictable or at the very least they lack plot twists and indeed any significant plot at all. all the character lines and the scripts as a whole look absolutely robotic. these are nonstories. a couple examples lin questions lucy about lots of strange deaths in their family what the actual f? and then this gem of a dialogue takes place i know nothing. seriously? yes seriously. same for oscar and lucy on the stage at some painters event where nobody is listening to oscar because lucy is telling jokes on the same stage but you are not even a painter! so what? people like my jokes. or something to this extent. i confess i couldnt force myself to finish even a single one yet. the horror. meanwhile in my longfinished dutch from english course there are no stories at all. in the french from dutch course there are still the good old stories with a plot meaningful dialogues and humansounding voices.,confusion,0.20644639432430267

3. Yes. ""AI first"" and ""human last"" is indistinguishable. All their effort to support LGBTQ went down the drain as they signaled an end to support for human beings. This was a communication disaster that there are no other recourse than management trying to be caring humans over time.
4. No. It's a quality and pricing issue, not a communication issue. If AI output truly was as good as the human content Duolingo formerly produced, I would have no problems with it. Add to it the exorbitant pricing of their AI content. Currently Max is 180% on top of the price for Super while the added AI features are maybe worth 20% on top of Super.

comment,mspayxd,1747433839.0,,"In my opinion, many companies are finding that genAI is a disappointment since correct output can never be better than the model, plus genAI produces hallucinations which means that the user needs to be expert in the subject area to distinguish good output from incorrect output.

When genAI creates output beyond the bounds of the model, an expert needs to validate that the output is valid. How can that be useful for non-expert users (i.e. the people that management wish to replace)?

Unless genAI provides consistently correct and useful output, GPUs merely help obtain a questionable output faster.

The root issue is the reliability of genAI. GPUs do not solve the root issue.

I am always going to be a fan of the idea of using AI to build better tools to do things that we couldn't do before. One big one would be the universal translators. 

However, as every one of these CEOs is drooling at the idea of getting rid of human labor or replacing it with AI, I still don't see them ever addressing the issue of what happens to society if nobody is able to work anymore and yet is still required to have an income? 

So perhaps AI is teaching children in school, but what happens if no one is working and they don't have the money to send their kids to school? That, or no one is working and there's no tax money coming in to pay for schools? 

I still feel like all these companies are clamoring to get the big tool made so they can get a lucrative non-competitive government contract and get rid of the idea of having to work in the capitalist system. They just take tax money and provide society. 

Then you're going to see the idea that all the money is going to come from those at the top, and they are going to feverishly work to move all their wealth out of the country, or even get into politics to start dumbing down and limiting and cutting down whatever services they are. So it costs them as little as possible.

But what is happening is that productivity is increasing and humans are being asked to do more. Some companies will scale this and grow and add humans. Some will reduce.

I am starting a customer service/sales BPO. Lot if articles saying this is end times for BPO’s. I’m probably crazy to start a biz in this industry. We will have autonomous customer service agents, SDR’s etc.

Maybe…

But my approach has been to leverage AI, train models on the client data, use AI for tedious mundane tasks and then escalate to humans when necessary. Trained AI also actively assists the human agents so quality is better.

But this does impact jobs. So in my case, I may have needed 50 human agents to service clients. Now I only need about 10.

So is this the “loss” of 40 jobs? Or the gain of 10 jobs that embrace AI?

This drastic increase in productivity will absolutely create chaos in a variety of industries (including BPO’s) but I believe there is still a place for humans in the equation.

I say this as a heavy user, been around since 2017 and have a nearly 1800 day long streak. Duolingo has consistently gotten worse and worse over the years, to the point where i fucking dread seeing an update to the app.

Never, in my life have i felt that way. There’s never been a good update. Each one takes away free features and makes it more frustrating to use. Most of the courses are badly designed and fail to really teach you anything other then basic phrases. They’ve gamified the entire experience so much that it barely feels like they’re even trying to teach you anything. Just hit the buttons and memorise some patterns so you can keep up your streak and climb a leaderboard. 

Thie whole AI shit is straight up embarrassing. These guys should be embarrassed they have such a terrible app and they’re trying to clog it full of garbage nobody wants. They have these ads for super that are delivered using AI voices and it’s pathetic. There’s so many other problems with Duolingo that even this heinous AI stuff isn’t at the top of the list.

Already, the fact that it is a publicly traded company is a bit of a red flag and simply put, language learning is *not* their primary goal and never will be.

What I eventually realized was the actual usage of Duolingo has a lot of wasted time baked into its gameification and pretty much you're better off just using flash cards most of the time.

comment,mqw2p3j,1746541929.0,,"I’m tired of AI bros coming in everytime and being like “bro bro, you’re going to regret acting like this isn’t nothing, it’s like the first computer bro”

AI in its current form isn’t even AI, ML has a ton of capabilities and we’ve been using it well for the longest, but all of this shit is like when we called “hoverboards” hoverboards, it has fucking wheels, it doesn’t make sense. The future definitely isn’t fucking chatbots and making our society’s critical thinking even worse with how it’s advertised.

When this shit is baked into already existing tools using ML, then it’ll capture my attention. But it’s fucking foolish to fall for investor lies and not hold these companies accountable. When there’s corporations literally pirating content with torrents (and also deleting it afterwards so not the good pirate) it’s a sign that shit isn’t thought out as much as you think it is behind the scenes. It’s nothing but smoke and mirrors dangling the idea that finally, corporations can get rid of people, because they don’t value any kind of future for us, not even a UBI one. They want to own our society and sell us a life, and if we can afford it, we might as well be dead or turn to crime.

That’s the uncool part of Cyberpunk they desperately want to make a reality because they’re inspired by the corpos controlling everything, not us living a life of luxury and freedom. Seeing that shit spread like we aren’t dealing with vile billionaires currently shows how fucking dumb AI bros are. Or maybe they think that they’re an exception like all egotistical “MCs” feel like they are, nah, you’re in the shitter with the rest of us. You don’t got “control the government” money do you?

I recently had a conversation with my partner about AI in education and wanted to hear the perspective of someone with real classroom experience.

Back when I was in school, I often had one teacher for about 32 students; I personally found that ratio challenging. At the risk of sounding arrogant, I’ve always been a quick learner. I often had simple clarifying questions—like whether a math problem used ""less than or equal to"" versus just ""less than""—but the teacher was understandably focused on helping students who needed more foundational support. I’d end up waiting, losing focus, and feeling frustrated, even though I generally performed well.

Now, I use AI tools to clarify things at work (I ask for sources to verify info); and I honestly think that if I’d had access to something like this during school, I could have performed even better and struggled less in university-level courses like calculus.

submission,1kutrnk,1748146130.0,Could AI Replace CEOs?,"AI hype has gone from exciting to unsettling. With the recent waves of layoffs, it's clear that entry and midlevel workers are the first on the chopping block. What's worse is that some companies aren't even hiding it anymore (microsoft, duolingo, klarna, ibm, etc) have openly said they're replacing real people with AI. It's obvious that it's all about cutting costs at the expense of the very people who keep these companies running. (not about innovation anymore)

within this context my question is:  
**Why the hell aren't we talking about replacing CEOs with AI?**

A CEO’s role is essentially to gather massive amounts of input data, forecasts, financials, employee sentiment and make strategic decisions. In other words navigating the company with clear strategic decisions. That’s what modern AI is built for. No emotion, no bias, no distractions. Just pure analysis, pattern recognition, and probabilistic reasoning. If it's a matter of judgment or strategy, Kasparov found out almost 30 years ago.

We're also talking about roles that cost millions (sometimes tens of millions) annually. (I'm obviously talking about large enterprises) Redirecting even part of that toward the teams doing the actual work could have a massive impact. (helping preserve jobs)

And the “human leadership” aspect of the role? Split it across existing execs or have the board step in for the public-facing pieces. Yes, I'm oversimplifying. Yes, legal and ethical frameworks matter. But if we trust AI to evaluate, fire, or optimize workforce or worse replace human why is the C-suite still off-limits?

I think this is the bit you're missing. Yes, AI could, and I'm sure is, be used as a tool for high analysis but there will always be a need for a human to take ownership of decisions and do the human leadership aspects. Saying you will just split the human leadership aspect across the board is basically just saying the board will be acting as CEO - and you real need one person not a committee as CEO so ultimately it will go back to one person as the CEO.

DK means you don't have the qualifications to evaluate the thing you're evaluating. Like me deciding if a golf swing is good or an engine design will work. I don't know anything about them. 

Most people have literally no idea what a CEO does at any level of company beyond about 200 employees. They have no idea the impact they can have, the value they can bring, the responsibilities they have, their motives, their accountability. 

I've worked with a few in limited ways and read a couple books about and by them. Obviously the books by them are designed to make them look good. But the ones about them, by objective journalists, also align with my experience. 

They are fallible and make mistakes. They screw up and overlook major factors. 

Just like we do. 

But their mistakes are much much more costly. Obviously. 

But usually they're intelligent, extremely knowledgeable, and *very* hardworking. Very.  They work a full day interacting with other workers and then spend a ton of time after hours reading voraciously because it is the only way to keep up with all the information they need to know to be competitive. 

And they are competitive. They are driven. They want to be good and they want to beat the competition and they want to grow the company. And that motive comes from within usually. 

I'm not idolizing them. But they are generally very competent. But they also make mistakes and screw up and it can ruin careers, departments, and companies. Just like anyone with very high responsibilities.

GenAI has all this information, but not the independent logic to know good from bad. A Reddit forum is the same as a whitepaper is the same as a blog is the same as a newspaper article in the LLM data pool.

Combine that information soup with feedback from contractors who are *not* trained writers, and you'll get... Average? Okay? output?

The problem is that bean counters are also not trained writers and can't understand the difference good writing makes, as opposed to ""more and cheaper"".

They will eventually ask why the AI work isn't converting or guiding business the way humans' work used to -- and probably around the same time the Gen AI companies bump up their prices.

Current strategy for those organizations is to get everyone hooked and dependent, operating at a loss -- $750k a *day* loss for ChatGPT alone -- and then, like Walmart, bump up the price when everyone is too far invested.
